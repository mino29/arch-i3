# üêß Arch-i3

Dotfiles for my i3wm config.
These can be annoyingly long and dull, because it's also a reminder of how I
set them up to myself.
Hope you find them useful in some way.

## üé® Colorscheme

- Primary: TokyoNight
- Secondary: Dracula
- Tertiary: Gruvbox

Use to love Nord, then realise the low contrast is hurting my eyes, switch to
TokyoNight. Wherever TokyoNight is unavailable I'd use Dracula. If neither are
available I use Gruvbox.

Making a colorscheme takes too much work and I'm too lazy for that.

## üíΩ Programs that I use

- colorscheme: tokyo-night
- OS: Arch Linux
- Machine: 2020 13.3" Razer Blade Stealth
- Terminal: Kitty/xterm
- Terminal Prompt: robbyrussell
- login manager: lightdm
- WM: i3
- Status bar: polybar
- fetch: neofetch/macchina
- launcher: rofi
- sys monitor: gotop
- notification: dunst
- text editor: vim / lunarvim
- code editor: vs code/vscodium
- image viewer: feh
- music player: spotify
- video player: haruna
- browser: google-chrome-stable
- file manager: pcmanfm/nautilus

I like simple and clean setup, so I got rid of fancy wallpaper transparency
and blur all together so I can focus more on what I'm currently working or
enjoying.

(I've tried awesome and hyprland, but i3 is just too comfortable to tweak
around, I might eventually switch to hyprland though, the animations are just too good)

## üîß Installation/setup

I would advise against copy and paste all my config blindly. It's better to
just pick and choose what you might find to your liking, that's how I built
mine.

But if you like to try them out and willing to take the time to fix whatever might
be broken in my config, here's what I would do.


1. clone this repo

```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/mino29/arch-i3.git
```

2. install all the packages (some maybe unnecessary)

```bash
cd ~/arh-i3/programs
paru -S -< packages.list --noconfirm --needed
```

3. fix whatever might be broken yourself, and good Luck!

export RELEASE="1.0.0"
wget https://github.com/antonmedv/countdown/releases/download/v$RELEASE/countdown_linux_amd64 -O countdown
chmod +x countdown
sudo mv countdown /usr/local/bin
```

```
usage:
    countdown 5s
    countdown 10m
```

## ‚úç fonts
> Hack Nerd Font is my favorite, I even use it on my windows gaming rig

places where you have to manually set font

- terminal:
    *kitty (`~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf)\
    *xterm (`~/.Xresources)\
- gui widgets: lxappearance
- status bar: polybar
- code editor: vscode/ vscodium
- browser: google-chrome humble-new-tab-page


## üìî text editor

> **vim**

I forked a ["minimal_vim"](https://github.com/mino29/minimal_vim), which is a cross platform, (neo)vim compatible,
dependency free config that you can bascially use anywhere.

It's simple, speedy and pretty good-looking. (uses gruvbox colorscheme)

> **lunarvim**

It's the most beautiful and functional neovim distribution that I ever used.
The maintainer Chris streams sometimes, I learned a lot from his neovim from
scratch youtube series.

> **vscodium**

The only gui text editor that I use, has similar keybinds to my minimal vim config.
Nothing special.
