# üêß Arch-i3

![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black)![Arch](https://img.shields.io/badge/Arch%20Linux-1793D1?logo=arch-linux&logoColor=fff&style=for-the-badge)

Dotfiles for my i3wm config.
These can be annoyingly long and dull, because it's also a reminder of how I
set them up to myself.
Hope you find them useful in some way.


## üé® Colorschemes

- Primary: TokyoNight
- Secondary: Dracula
- Tertiary: Gruvbox

Used to love Nord, then realise the low contrast is hurting my eyes, switch to
TokyoNight. Wherever TokyoNight is unavailable I'd use Dracula. If neither are
available I use Gruvbox.

Making a colorscheme takes too much work and I'm too lazy for that.

## üíΩ Programs that I use

- Colorscheme: TokyoNight
- OS: Arch Linux
- Machine: 2020 13.3" Razer Blade Stealth
- Terminal: kitty/ xterm
- Terminal Prompt: robbyrussell
- Login manager: lightdm
- WM: i3-gaps
- Status bar: polybar
- Fetch: neofetch/macchina
- Launcher: rofi
- Sys monitor: btop/gotop
- Notification: dunst
- Text editor: vim/ lunarvim
- Code editor: vs code/ vscodium
- Image viewer: feh/ sxiv
- Music player: spotify
- Video player: haruna
- Vrowser: google-chrome-stable
- File manager: pcmanfm/nautilus
- File sync/transfer: warpinator/syncthing

I like simple and clean setup, so I got rid of fancy wallpaper transparency
and blur all together so I can focus more on what I'm currently working on or
enjoying.

(I've tried dwm, awesome and hyprland, but i3 is just too comfortable to tweak
around, I might eventually switch to hyprland though, the animations are just too good)

## üîß Installation/setup

I would advise against copying and pasting all my config blindly. It's better to
just pick and choose what you might find to your liking, that's how I built
mine.

But if you like to try them out and willing to take the time to fix whatever might
be broken in my config, here's what I would do.

1. clone this repo

```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/mino29/arch-i3.git
```

2. install all the packages (some maybe unnecessary)

```bash
cd ~/arh-i3/programs
paru -S -< packages.list --noconfirm --needed
```

3. fix whatever might be broken yourself, and good Luck!


## Mouse and touchpad config

- [synaptics](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Touchpad_Synaptics)

I prefer:

- reverse/natural scrolling
- single click to left click
- double finger click to right click
- no tapping

## Some processes

**countdown-cli**
> a neat little count down tool

```bash
export RELEASE="1.0.0"
wget https://github.com/antonmedv/countdown/releases/download/v$RELEASE/countdown_linux_amd64 -O countdown
chmod +x countdown
sudo mv countdown /usr/local/bin
```

```
usage:
    countdown 5s
    countdown 10m
```

## ‚úç fonts
> Hack Nerd Font is my favorite, I even use it on my windows gaming rig

places where you have to manually set font

- terminal:
     - kitty (~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf)
     - xterm (~/.Xresources)
- gui widgets: lxappearance
- status bar: polybar
- code editor: vscode/ vscodium
- browser: google-chrome humble-new-tab-page


## üìî text editor

> **vim**

I forked a ["minimal_vim"](https://github.com/mino29/minimal_vim), which is cross platform, (neo)vim compatible,
dependency free config that you can bascially use anywhere.

It's simple, speedy and pretty good-looking. (uses gruvbox colorscheme)

> **lunarvim**

It's the most beautiful and functional neovim distribution that I ever used.
The maintainer Chris streams sometimes, I learned a lot from his neovim from
scratch youtube series.

> **vscodium**

The only gui text editor that I use, has similar keybinds to my minimal vim config.
Nothing special.

## üíàPolybar

> This section might be extremely long, I had most fun tinkering polybar while
> ricing.

It might seem that I made this bar super huge when in reality it's just a
floating one, it has space on 4 size, then I made it has the same background
color as the wallpaper, so it has this borderless look.

You might not like this top-bezel looking setup, but my latop has a pretty
signifiant bottom bezel, so this setup on my machine is pretty balanced
visually as a whole.

Here are my end goals for this polybar setup:

- Minimalistic
- Productivity and efficiency focused

I've these rules for myself:

- No more than 4 colors (unimportant, important, alert and system tray icon
  color)
- Every module should be clickable
- Modules should be properly spaced out without an ugly underline or a square
- Just the essential stats, I don't want to know how many ram or cpu cores or
  storage I'm using.
- Just show the important part of the window title, never the full long one,
  it' will only clutter the status bar.
