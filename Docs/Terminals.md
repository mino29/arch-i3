# Terminal emulator configs

## Terminal that I actually use

- Kitty
> cute icon, cute name, fully featured

- Alacritty
> weird name, but the best in the business, auto load config is no
  brainer, font size is kind of weird on different wm though.

## Terminal that I tried and forgot to use

- gnome terminal
> pretty good, not very easy to customize
- Konsole
> Never liked it, should've called it console
- foot
> foot fetish?
- st
> someday when I'm more comfortable using dwm, I'll use it
- xterm
> huge pain that you have to manually reload .Xresources to customize
- uxterm
> huge pain that you have to manually reload .Xresources to customize
- urxvt
> huge pain that you have to manually reload .Xresources to customize
